# email-integration-service

## Motivation
This mail-integration service is as a RESTful HTTP API that can perform the duty as an integration service to send emails. It can be an abstraction over an unlimited number of Email Clients that **can** be used to send emails. This provides resiliance in case one email client goes down. Currently, only two email clients are supported.
